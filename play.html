  				<br>
  				<p>I am a junior studying <span>Computer Science</span> at the University of Washington.</p>

  				<p>I lived in Mumbai, India until I moved to Seattle when I was 10, so I've had a great mix of cultures to admire growing up.</p>	

  				<p>I love tackling coding problems and making exciting user experiences. I had an absolutely fantastic summer doing that as a Mobile Development Intern at Tack Technologies (open for <a class="link" href="http://tacktechnologies.com/">private alpha</a>). Every day brought a new challenge and something to laugh about the day after.</p>

  				<p>This year, I was an officer for ACM-W, the women's chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery at UW as well as the head photographer/historian for my sorority, Phi Sigma Rho.</p>	

  				<p>Other than that, I am very enthusiastic and easily amused. I love the modern aesthetic, curating music playlists, and trying different kinds of food.</p>
